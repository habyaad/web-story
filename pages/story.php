            <h1>My Story</h1>
        </h2>
		<article>
			<h2>Chapter 1: Getting into UNIBADAN</h2>
			<p>I gained admission into the university of Ibadan, computer science dept. in 2019, ideally, we were to resume in 2020, but, the corona virus outbreak, happened and we had a delay in session.</p>

			<p>Before i resumed, i had been a private school teacher, i have been teaching since 2017, then, i was only 14 years old then but i was quite good, i prepared some kids for their common entrance exam, currently as i write, they are in SS2(2023). </p>

            <p>So, all through the break and time i had been at home, i was teaching, and up till now, i still do, whenever i go home for a break. I wasn't aware when we resumed our 100 level first semester(2021), my mates were about 5 to 6 weeks into lectures before i even got to know we had a departmental whatsapp group. i joined and did all the necessary registration and joined the session in having online classes.</p>

			<h2>Chapter 2: Resuming physical classes for exams</h2>
			<p>We resumed physically about 3 weeks before our first exam, i had no-one in ibadan, so a night before i journeyed down from lagos, i put a phone call through to olarsh, the head of the muslim students as at 2019 when i came to write my exam, to help me with somewhere to stay, but as at then(2021), he was at nysc camp already, so he connected me with a fellow 100 level student, lamlad, as he is fondly called(econnomics dept.), he was so loyal to olarsh and ready to do anything to make me comfortable, lamlad was officially the first person i got acquainted with in UNIBADAN, i see him as my benevolent, i was at his place in agbowo for about a week before i could arrange my accomodation in MELLANBY hostel.</p>

			<p>The next person i met is micheal, OJURI, as he is fondly called, we are in the same department, level and hostel, he helped me move my things from lamlad's place into mellanby after my room was set, an unpopular opinion i hold is, micheal is the best student in our dept. but it seems i am the only one aware, it is just a matter of time for it to be apparent. people thought we were twins in 100 level because we always moved together(till now even) and we used glasses too(mine is not recommended though), he is an erudite and has my respect</p>

            <p>Timilehin Aduragbemi Oyeniyi, TAO, was my roommate in 100 level, we were just two in the room, he is a bold, nice and very productive human, he stood up to the excos in the hostel speaking against all the inadequacies, and is one of the factors we got a hoodie instead of a round neck top as our hostel wear. </p>

			<h2>Chapter 3: Journey so far</h2>
			<p>Immediately i resumed to ibadan physically, i became so reserved which is unlike me, i was observing a lot of things, i was not so free, i didn't talk to people so much, moving like a one-man mopol, i was not so known in my department throughout my 100 level days. It is much better now as i have started to interact in my department.
            </p>

			<p>I have learnt never to underestimate any person you see, because, the person ho you think is very unserious because you never see him reading or studying but playing all the time might have a better result than you do, what works for one person might not work for another. We are being pushed out of our comfort zone to take on tasks that are almost impossible, like learning about 7 programming languages in a session.</p>

      <p>Whenever i go home for breaks, most of the time i serve my parents and whenever i set out to return to school, they rain supplications on me which keeps me going, that's why i say if you're not well grounded you might have to leave the road for what is coming is somewhat mighty. I would write my name on the wet cement of the walls of UNIBADAN so as not to be forgotten(so help me God).</p>
